      To design a bold, creative and unifying visual identity for the 38th Grand

      together the entire cultural and business community around the importance
      of local artistic vitality.

        The campaign includes the driving concept and visual signature of the
        event as well as all its advertising, digital and scenographic
        applications. A true tribute to local creators and organizations, this
        38th edition takes the form of an annual gala where they are rewarded,
        as well as a contest in which Montrealers are invited to vote for their
        favourite artistic proposal (Télé-Québec People's Choice Award).

        Highlighting the year's promising artistic projects in various
        disciplines (Indigenous arts, circus arts, digital arts, visual arts,
        dance, music, theatre and multidisciplinary sectors), the list of 8
        finalists paints an impressive portrait of the quality of the arts
        organizations that help define Montreal today.
